# silver-standard-performance

A light and flexible R package for plotting PR/ROC curves.

More importantly, it plots PR/ROC curves for your scoring scheme on trait/gene pairs using a some existing silver standard.

The initial effort is at [this gist post](https://gist.github.com/liangyy/6d4314dbc238236731e134abef2484f4).

~**TODO**: have a function takes in GWAS loci by trait and output the list of trait/gene pairs to look at. Essentially, it takes the intersect of GWAS loci and silver standard trait/gene pairs.~

**TODO**: add a documentation of how silver standard, gene annotation, and ld block datasets are formatted so that it is easier for people to contribute their own.

**TODO**: add a more comprehensive readme explaining what we are doing.
